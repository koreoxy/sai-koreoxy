        Hello! <br />
        I&apos;,m Saifullah, but feel free to call me Iful or Ipul. I&apos;,m a
        22-year-old web development enthusiast from Meulaboh, West Aceh,
        Indonesia. With 3 years of academic background in Computer Science at
        Teuku Umar University, my journey in programming began in 2020 with C++.
        Since then, my passion has evolved toward web development, where I now
        focus on building dynamic web applications using Next.js and Laravel.
        I&apos;,m always eager to learn and take on new challenges to sharpen my
        skills in creating efficient and user-friendly digital experiences.
